## 考題
> 請將答案另外寫在空白紙上

1. Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
	
	**example:**
	
	```text
	Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,
	
	Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
	return [0, 1].
```


1. Given an integer, convert it to a roman numeral. Input is guaranteed to be within the range from 1 to 3999.

	
	**Solution:**
	
	```java
	class Solution {
	    public String intToRoman(int num) {
	        
	    }
	}
	```
	
1. You are given an n x n 2D matrix representing an image.

	Rotate the image by 90 degrees (clockwise).

	**Note:**
	You have to rotate the image in-place, which means you have to modify the input 2D matrix directly. DO NOT allocate another 2D matrix and do the rotation.
	
	**Example 1:**
	
	```
	Given input matrix = 
	[
	  [1,2,3],
	  [4,5,6],
	  [7,8,9]
	],
	
	rotate the input matrix in-place such that it becomes:
	[
	  [7,4,1],
	  [8,5,2],
	  [9,6,3]
	]
	```
	**Example 2:**
	
	```
	Given input matrix =
	[
	  [ 5, 1, 9,11],
	  [ 2, 4, 8,10],
	  [13, 3, 6, 7],
	  [15,14,12,16]
	], 
	
	rotate the input matrix in-place such that it becomes:
	[
	  [15,13, 2, 5],
	  [14, 3, 4, 1],
	  [12, 6, 8, 9],
	  [16, 7,10,11]
	]
	```
	
	**Solution:**
	
	```java
	class Solution {
	    public void rotate(int[][] matrix) {
	        
	    }
	}
	```
